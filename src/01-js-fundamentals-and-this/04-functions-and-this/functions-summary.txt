Regarding 'new', don't get confused between
- new myConstructorFunction (for creating objects from a constructor function)
- new Function (for creating new functions from text)


Function variables vs parameters of the function-object:

  Functions can be treated like objects (they are).

  So we can create variables inside function logic, using let and const, but we
  can also assign properties to the function object itself.
  
  The function logic can be made to interact with the function's parameters
  itself, and this can be used to track function meta - eg: how many times the
  function was called, etc.


NFE:

  Sometimes, you may want a function to be able to reference itself. This is
  when you think you may change the name of the function or copy it or assign
  it to another variable, but you still want that function to be able to
  reference itself. You can do this by using a Named Function Expression (NFE).
  Know that this technique requires us to use a function expression - normal
  function declarations do not have access to this feature.
