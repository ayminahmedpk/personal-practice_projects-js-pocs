Map, Filter & Reduce:

Note: Neither of these three modify the original array.

  Map:
  // arr.map(function(item, index, array) { ... });
  Returns a new array, values are results of transformation on original array's
  values.
  The given function should return the value to be pushed into the new array.

  Filter:
  // arr.filter(function(item, index, array) { ... });
  Returns a new array, which includes only some values of the original array,
  filtered based on the given function.
  The given function should return either true or false, which determines
  whether the current element is pushed into the new array or not.

  // arr.reduce(function(accumulator, item, index, array) {
  //   // ...
  // }, [initial]);
  Persistenly remembers a value (the accumulator), and modifies it based on the
  given function while traversing the array. At the end, returns the
  accumulator.
  Can optionally accept a value to use as the initial value for the accumulator.
  The given reducer function must return the accumulator, which will be carried
  forward to the next iteration.
