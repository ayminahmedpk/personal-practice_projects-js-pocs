RMP:
Before module systems existed, Revealing Module Pattern (RMP) was being used to
mimic module like functionality.

Since even old JS always had function level scope, functions were used to
encapsulate some private properties with public setter/getter, and return
the setter/getter - so the private property would remain in memory and exist
till the program lived.

Multiple modules could be defined in a script, but they could not be loaded
asynchronously, nor be imported programmatically.




CJS:
Alternative developed that used the keywords 'require' and 'export'.
