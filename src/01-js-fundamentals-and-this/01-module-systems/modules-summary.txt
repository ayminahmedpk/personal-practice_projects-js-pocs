IIFE / RMP - Immediately Invoked Function Expression / Revealing Module Pattern:

	Uses functions scope to encapsulate private fields and provide working
	  structures. Could be directly namespaced to global / parent containers
	  (IIFE), or simply returned and namespaced by caller (RMP).
	IIFE / RMP are executed and a new instance is returned at every call.


CJS - Common JS

	A more organized module system.
	Uses "exports.myItem = myItem " and "require('...')" statements.
	Can import / export multiple items per file.
	Can be imported multiple times, but only executed and instantiated at
	  the first import (require statement). Thereafter, cached and referenced.
	Synchronous, so not compatible with ESM.
	Not supported by browsers by default.


Node CJS implementation

	Implementation of CJS, therefore fairly similar.
	Uses "module.exports" rather than "exports".
	Some syntactical differences, but overall operation similar.


AMD - skipped.
UMD - skipped.


ESM - ECMA Modules / ES6 Modules

	Moden module system.
	Imports are not instantiated automatically - they are simply scanned and
	  a dynamic interface is created for them.
	Instantiated when actually needed by the code or program.
	Asynchronous, not compatible with CJS.
	Supported by browsers (at least most of them).
	<script> tag needs type="module", though.
