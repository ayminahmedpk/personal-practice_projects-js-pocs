Focus on:
  - Syntax
  - Property descriptors (flags)
  - Hiding properties using flags, viewing hidden properties
  - Copying (cloining), with and/or without hidden properties
  - Accessors

Leave 'this' for its own specific section.
Which will have objects as well as functions.

Leave 'new' and constructor functio for prototype based inheritance.



Syntax:
  - CREATE object
  - List object properties
  - Modify Object
    - ADD    properties
    - READ   properties
    - QUERY  properties
    - DELETE properties
  - CLONE object
  
Accessors:
  - Data properties
  - Accessor properties

READ and MODIFY property descriptors:
  - Normal descriptors vs Accessor descriptors
  - Changing descriptors
    - Making non-writable
    - Hiding
    - Making non-configurable
  - Then repeat the syntax tests above
  - Then repeat accessor tests above
