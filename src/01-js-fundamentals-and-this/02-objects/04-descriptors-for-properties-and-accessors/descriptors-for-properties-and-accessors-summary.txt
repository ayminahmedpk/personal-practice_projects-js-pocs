Four type of property descriptors:
  - value
  - writable
  - enumberable
  - configurable
, all self-explanatory.

Value is value of property.
The remaining three are always boolean (true or false).
All 3 are true by default.

Configurable can be made to false, essentially locking the item's descriptors.
After configurable false, can not delete item.
After configurable false, can still change item's value.
After configurable false, can still change writable to false.
However, after configurable->false and writable->false, can't delete or edit it.

Enumerable false hides the property from listing methods that do consider the
enumerable descriptor, like Object.keys(myObj) or the the for..in loop.
