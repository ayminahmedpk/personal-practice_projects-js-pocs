Accessing individual property:

  Can access individual object property by
    object.myDotProperty;
    object['myBracketProperty'];

  The brackets can only accept a string, so we must pass a string, not just
  myBracketProperty (hence the quotes).

  If we just passed myBracketProperty, JS would try to resolve myBracketProperty
  to a string, and crash with an error at that point.


Deleting a property:

  delete myObj.unwantedProperty;
