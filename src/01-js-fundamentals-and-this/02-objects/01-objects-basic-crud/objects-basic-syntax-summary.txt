Accessing individual property:

  Can access individual object property by
    object.myDotProperty;
    object['myBracketProperty'];

  The brackets can only accept a string, so we must pass a string, not just
  myBracketProperty (hence the quotes).

  If we just passed myBracketProperty, JS would try to resolve myBracketProperty
  to a string, and crash with an error at that point.




Listing properties:

  When listing object properties, some methods list only enumerable ones, some
  list only those not-inherited, and none list all without considering
  inheritance or enumerability.

  excerpt:
    "After seeing Mozilla's JS documentation specifically say: "no single
    mechanism iterates all of an object's properties; the various mechanisms
    each include different subsets of properties."

  Object.keys                = string array, own/inherited keys, enumerable
  Object.getOwnPropertyNames = string array, own keys, enumerable/non-enumerable
  (key in myObject)          = iterates over own/inherited enumerable keys
