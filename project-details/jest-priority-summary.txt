  Summary:

  The tests are neatly piled in a different order in the results screen, but
  the console logs indicate a different story.

  According to the console logs:

  
    * All statements are collected first and executed sequentially, ignoring the
      nesting inside any describe blocks.


    * All tests are gathered together and executed sequentially, ignoring the
      nesting inside any describe blocks - but note that the before/after
      statements (setups and teardowns) will be applied on these tests in a
      specific order (see below).
    

    * The before and after statements are collected and applied, RESPECTING the
      describe block scope.
        
        Before all outside any describe block (if first test in file)
        Before all in this describe block (if first test in describe block)
        Before each outside any describe block
        Before each in this describe block

                          <test takes place here>
            
        After each in this describe block
        After each outside any describe block
        After all in this describe block (if last test in describe block)
        After all outside any describe block (if last test in file)
